Consider a dart board.  Distances are marked from the dart board at every 5 feet by a whiteline.  Line 1=5 ft, Line 2=10ft, etc.Players have to stand on these lines and try to hit the bullseyeon the board.  We will assume that1.  If the player is able to hit the bullseye at Linex, then he/she can also hit the bullseye atany line numbered less thanx.2.  If the player misses the bullseye at Linex, then he/she will also miss the bullseye at linenumbered greater thanx.3.  If you miss, you cannot reuse your dart.  However, if you hit the bullseye you can reuse thedart4.  Only hitting the bullseye counts â€“anything else is a miss
